# Book Library Application

## Introduction

Create a comprehensive book library application that empowers administrators to seamlessly add, search, and categorize books within their collection. Meanwhile, customers gain access to a wealth of book collections, fostering an enriching reading experience.

## Features

### Admin Registration and Authentication:

- Admin can create an account and log in securely.
- Admin authentication will be implemented to ensure data privacy so that control is in the hands of the admin.

### Book Management:

- Admin can add new books to their library by entering book details such as title, author, genre, publication date, and book cover image.
- Admin can also edit and delete books from their library.
- Customers can only read the books but have no access to the database to avoid unwanted changes.

### Book Search and Filtering:

- Users can search for books in the library based on various criteria such as title, author, or genre.
- Filtering options will help users find books based on different parameters.

### User Interface and Experience:

- The application will have a responsive and intuitive user interface for seamless usage across devices.
- User-friendly interactions and visualizations will enhance the user experience.

## Problem Statement

The Book Library project aims to create a web application that allows admins to manage and organize the library book collections. Admins will be able to keep track of their books, add new books, delete and update books. The customer will only be able to read the books and they can also use filters to get desired books. The project will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to ensure a full-stack development approach.

## Solution

### System Requirements

**MERN Stack:**

- **MongoDB:** A versatile NoSQL database to efficiently store and manage your book information and user data.
- **Express JS:** The powerhouse backend framework that simplifies API development, streamlines server-side logic, and interfaces seamlessly with MongoDB.
- **React:** Your trusted frontend library for crafting dynamic, interactive, and visually stunning user interfaces that connect effortlessly with your Express backend.
- **Node JS:** The server-side JavaScript runtime environment that enables the use of JavaScript across your entire application stack, making integration with React and Express a breeze.
- **Axios:** A powerful HTTP client for Node.js and browsers that simplifies sending HTTP requests to your Express API.
- **JavaScript (JS):** The language that powers the dynamic behavior of your web application, whether it's on the frontend with React or on the backend with Express and Node.js.
- **bcrypt:** A robust library for securely hashing and storing passwords, enhancing the security of your user data in MongoDB.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a compact and self-contained token, often used for authentication and authorization in your application.

### Frontend

#### Project Setup

- Set up a new React project using a tool like Create React App or a custom configuration.
- Ensure that the project structure is organized with clear directories for components, styles, images, and other assets.

#### Admin Authentication

- Implement admin registration and login forms using React components to make the changes in the database.
- Integrate authentication libraries like Firebase or implement custom authentication logic.
- Manage admin sessions and tokens to keep admins authenticated.

#### User Interface Design

- Design a user interface (UI) for the application using React components and a styling framework like CSS, Bootstrap, or styled-components.
- Create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using Bootstrap framework.
- Design components for displaying book entries, forms, buttons, and navigation elements.

#### Display Book Collection

- Create a component to fetch and display the library book collection.
- Fetch data from the backend API using Axios.
- Render the book entries in a visually appealing and organized manner, potentially using grid or list layouts.

#### Add New Book

- Design a form component for adding new book details such as title, author, genre, publication year, and cover image.
- Implement form validation to ensure accurate and complete data entry.
- Handle form submission, sending the data to the backend API for storage.

#### Search and Filters

- Develop a search bar component that allows users to search for books by title, author, or other criteria.
- Implement filtering options to narrow down the displayed book collection based on specific attributes.
- Update the displayed results in real-time as users input search queries or apply filters.

#### Edit and Delete Books

- Add functionality to edit and delete book entries.
- Implement edit and delete buttons within each book entry, triggering modals or confirmation dialogs.
- Update the UI and backend data accordingly when changes are made.

#### UI/UX Enhancements

- Implement smooth animations and transitions for improved user experience.
- Consider adding tooltips, hover effects, and subtle animations to enhance interactivity.
- Ensure consistent typography, color schemes, and design patterns across the app.

#### Error Handling and Feedback

- Display meaningful error messages for scenarios like failed API requests or validation errors.
- Provide user feedback on successful actions like book addition, deletion, or updates.
